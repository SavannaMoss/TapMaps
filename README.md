# TapMaps

## About
Utilizing the Google Maps API, VueJS, and Firebase Firestore database to develop a progressive web application called TapMaps. We created a proof of concept based on our college campus for a localized, information-filled, interactive map. We plan on continuing the project with the goal of adding more functionality and features in the future.
